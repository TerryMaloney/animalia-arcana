You are working on the Animalia Arcana project â€” a Flutter-based Tarot app that features animal-themed cards.

PROJECT GOALS:
1. Ensure the Flutter app builds and runs without errors on web, Android, and desktop.
2. Fix the asset loading issue where images are returning 404 errors (remove double 'assets/' prefixes, normalize filenames, ensure pubspec.yaml paths match).
3. Implement card-click interactivity so when a user clicks a card, it flips or shows details.
4. Improve image quality by using higher-resolution assets without slowing performance.
5. Keep all code clean, modular, and well-commented for future edits.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not change existing theme colors or overall card art style without explicit instruction.
- Maintain Flutter/Dart best practices and avoid deprecated methods.
- Optimize for performance to handle smooth animations even on lower-end devices.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Audit and fix all asset paths in pubspec.yaml.
2. Add interactivity for tarot card selection.
3. Ensure responsive UI for mobile and web.
4. Test all changes before committing.

DEVELOPMENT STYLE:
- Be concise and focused in commits (small, logical changes).
- Commit early and often with clear messages.
- Write comments explaining WHY a change was made, not just WHAT it does.
